    Following is the class structure of the Node class:

        class Node:
            def __init__(self, data):

                self.data = data
                self.next = None

   while temp.next != None:
       count += 1
       temp = temp.next
   count = count - (k - 1)
   while count != 0:
       head = head.next
       count -= 1
